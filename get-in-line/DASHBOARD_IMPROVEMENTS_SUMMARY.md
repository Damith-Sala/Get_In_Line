3. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-like suggestions based on user history
4. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded statuses and progress indicators
5. **Contextual Actions**: Quick actions that make sense for current state

## üß™ Testing

### **API Endpoints Tested**
- ‚úÖ `/api/users/me/dashboard` - Returns 401 when not authenticated (expected)
- ‚úÖ `/api/users/me/notifications` - Proper authentication handling
- ‚úÖ `/api/queues/recommended` - Smart recommendation algorithm

### **Error Handling**
- Authentication errors (401) handled gracefully
- Network errors with retry options
- Loading states with skeleton UI
- Fallback content for empty states

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **Immediate Improvements**
1. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Push Notifications**: Browser notification API integration
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Charts and graphs for user statistics
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Machine Learning**: More sophisticated recommendation algorithm
2. **Social Features**: Share queue status with friends
3. **Gamification**: Points and achievements system
4. **Integration**: Calendar integration for queue scheduling

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified
