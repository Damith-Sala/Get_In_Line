# Customer Queue Creation Restrictions

## Overview
Removed queue creation options from regular customer frontends to ensure only business accounts can create and manage queues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Page (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Added role-based dashboard**: Different content for customers vs business users
- **Customer Dashboard**: Shows "Browse Available Queues" instead of "Create New Queue"
- **Business Dashboard**: Shows "Create New Queue" for business users
- **Navigation**: Business Admin link only shows for non-customer users

### 2. Role Detection
- **Added user role fetching**: Dashboard now fetches user role from database
- **Dynamic content**: Content changes based on user role (customer, staff, admin, super_admin)

## Customer Experience

### Before (❌)
- Customers could see "Create New Queue" button
- All users had same dashboard experience
- Confusing interface for customers

### After (✅)
- **Customers see**:
  - "Browse Available Queues" button
  - "My Queue Entries" section
  - Quick actions for viewing queues
  - No business admin navigation

- **Business users see**:
  - "Create New Queue" button
  - Business admin navigation
  - Queue management options

## User Roles

### Customer Role
- Can browse and join queues
- Can view their queue entries
- Cannot create or manage queues
- Cannot access business admin features

### Business Roles (staff, admin, super_admin)
- Can create and manage queues
- Can access business admin features
- Can view business analytics
- Can manage staff and customers

## API Protection
- Queue creation API already protected (only business users)
- Queue deletion API already protected (only business users)
- Frontend now matches API restrictions

## Testing

### Test Customer Dashboard
1. Sign up as regular customer
2. Login and go to dashboard
3. Verify no "Create Queue" options
4. Verify "Browse Available Queues" is shown

### Test Business Dashboard
1. Sign up as business owner/staff
2. Login and go to dashboard
3. Verify "Create New Queue" is shown
4. Verify business admin navigation is available

## Benefits
- **Clear separation**: Customers vs business users have different experiences
- **Reduced confusion**: Customers can't accidentally try to create queues
- **Better UX**: Role-appropriate interface for each user type
- **Security**: Frontend matches backend restrictions
