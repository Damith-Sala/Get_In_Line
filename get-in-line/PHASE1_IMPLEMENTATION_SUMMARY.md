  name: text
  role: text (user, staff, admin, super_admin)
  businessId: uuid (nullable)
}

-- Businesses table
businesses {
  id: uuid
  name: text
  ownerId: uuid (FK -> users.id)
  businessType: text
  isActive: boolean
}

-- Business staff table
business_staff {
  id: uuid
  businessId: uuid (FK -> businesses.id)
  userId: uuid (FK -> users.id)
  role: text (staff, manager, admin)
  permissions: text (JSON)
}
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Unified Registration?
- **Better UX:** Business users (owners + staff) share similar needs
- **Less Complexity:** 2 registration paths instead of 3
- **Easier Maintenance:** Shared components and logic
- **Logical Grouping:** Clear distinction between customers and business users

### Why Multi-Step Form?
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Don't overwhelm users with too many fields
- **Clear Decision Points:** Users can focus on one choice at a time
- **Better Validation:** Validate each step before proceeding
- **Improved Completion Rates:** Psychological progress indicator

### Why Real-Time Search?
- **User Convenience:** Find business quickly without typing exact name
- **Error Prevention:** Select from list rather than type ID
- **Discovery:** Users can browse available businesses
- **Better UX:** Immediate feedback on search results

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Staff Approval:** Staff can join any business (will be addressed in Phase 2)
2. **No Email Verification:** Business accounts created without email verification
3. **No Business Invitations:** Can't invite staff by email yet
4. **No Business Deactivation:** Can't prevent staff from joining inactive businesses in search

These will be addressed in future phases.

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ **TypeScript:** Full type safety
- ✅ **Validation:** Zod schemas for runtime validation
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with proper error messages
- ✅ **Clean Code:** Organized, readable, well-commented
- ✅ **No Linter Errors:** All files pass ESLint
- ✅ **Consistent Styling:** Follows existing project patterns
